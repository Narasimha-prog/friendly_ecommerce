Spring / Application Logging Levels — Meaning & Usage
------------------------------------------------------------
Level	Verbosity    	What it Covers	   Typical Examples	      When to Us
TRACE	🔊 Highest	  Internal flow & lifecycle	Bean creation, dependency wiring, method entry/exit, classpath scanning	Deep framework debugging, learning Spring internals
DEBUG	🔍 High	Decision making & configuration	Auto-config decisions, security rules, SQL execution, condition matches	Debugging logic/config issues
INFO	ℹ️ Normal	Normal application flow	App startup, user login success, order placed	Day-to-day runtime visibility
WARN	⚠️ Low	Unexpected but handled problems	Invalid input, deprecated API use, fallback logic	Signal potential issues without breaking flow
ERROR	❌ Lowest	System / unrecoverable errors	Exceptions, DB down, authentication failure


TRACE → How the framework works internally
DEBUG → Why a decision was taken
INFO  → What the application is doing
WARN  → Something odd happened, but we recovered
ERROR → Something broke and needs attention


Production guidance (important)
Environment	Recommended Levels
Local dev	TRACE / DEBUG (selective)
QA / Staging	DEBUG / INFO
Production	INFO / WARN / ERROR only


TRACE → bean creation / lifecycle

DEBUG → decisions

INFO → normal flow

WARN → unexpected but non-critical

ERROR → internal/system failure
